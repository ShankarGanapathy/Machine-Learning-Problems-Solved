## Problem Statement <br>
An Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online <br>but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. <br>Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a <br>personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a 
<br>mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
<br>
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their <br>mobile app experience or their website.<br>
They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out!
